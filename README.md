# Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) regression for insurance claims data

These are the R codes for the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) and the Pitman-Yor process mixture model (PYMM) applied to the insurance claims data in my preprint *Modeling Insurance Claims using Bayesian Nonparametric Regression* available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11487). Each code consists of the model's MCMC sampling algorithm, posterior predictive distribution computation, and clustering performance.
