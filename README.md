# Bayesian Nonparametric (BNP) Regression for Insurance Claims Data

This repository contains R code for the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) and the Pitman–Yor process mixture model (PYMM) applied to the insurance claims data in our manuscript *"Modeling Insurance Claims Using Bayesian Nonparametric Regression"* by Mostafa Shams and Kaushik Ghosh (available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11487)).

Each script includes the model’s MCMC sampling algorithm, computation of the posterior predictive distribution, and evaluation of clustering performance.
